# TinyBlog
See it in action: http://petabyte.heb12.com/blog/

## Setup
In the posts folder, create your files 1 for the first post, 2 for the second, and so on.  
Posts are formatted in using a custom Markdown parser in Regex, but can be disabled if you  
want to just use HTML.

The source is very small, and can easily be customized without having to  
dig through the source code.

## TODO:
Write a non-PHP implementation in Go (I'm not motivated to do this at the moment)
Create newpost.sh (create new post) and editpost.sh (edit last post)
