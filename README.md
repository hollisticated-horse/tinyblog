# TinyBlog
Single File HTML/CSS/PHP blog in less than 100 lines.  
See it in action: http://petabyte.heb12.com/blog/  

## Setup
In the posts folder, create your files 1 for the first post, 2  
for the second, and so on. This can easily be modified for a  
better experience. Posts are formatted in using a custom Markdown  
parser in Regex, but can be disabled if you want to just use HTML.  


The source is very small, and can very quickly be customized to your needs.  

## Markdown Syntax
TinyBlog has a built-in Markdown parser. It supports most of the typical  
Markdown syntax, but currently has one additional feature:  

- Type `---` to insert a "Read More" link, and cut off the rest of the text.
